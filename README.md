# miRNAEnrich
miRNA Enrichment in microarray dataset
This package computes enrichment of miRNAs based on enrichment of their Target genes in the test set. It will compute a fisher test against the background (expressed gene set). Utilizes the Targetscan and microRNA.org Miranda databases for miRNA-Target relationships.
